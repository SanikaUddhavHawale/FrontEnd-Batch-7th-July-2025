       Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be 
       displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted 
       by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
       Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
       into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
       included cues for its appearance.
       HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects 
       such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
       structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
       links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
       Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and 
      surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. 
       Browsers sdo not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
